file:
Linux Directory Structure:
1. / – Root :
    Every single file and directory starts from the root directory
    Only root user has write privilege under this directory 
2. /bin – User Binaries
    Contains binary executables
    Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory
3. /sbin – System Binaries
    Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables
4. /etc – Configuration Files
    Contains configuration files required by all programs
    For example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf
5. /dev – Device Files
    Contains device files.
    These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
    For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0
6. /proc – Process Information   
    Contains information about system process.   
    This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process
7. /var – Variable Files
    var stands for variable files.
    Content of the files that are expected to grow can be found under this directory
8. /tmp – Temporary Files
    Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users
9. /usr – User Programs
   Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs
10. /home – Home Directories
    Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
    For example: /home/john, /home/nikita
11. /boot – Boot Loader Files
    Contains boot loader related files.
    Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
    For example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic
12. /lib – System Libraries
    Contains library files that supports the binaries located under /bin and /sbin
    Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
    For example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7
13. /opt – Optional add-on Applications
    opt stands for optional.
    Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
    add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.
14. /mnt – Mount Directory
    Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.
15. /media – Removable Media Devices    
    Temporary mount directory for removable device

Listing Files

ls          listed files
ls  -l      long listed files 
ls  -il     list files with inode number 
ls  -a     list hidden files 

Display content of files:            cat ,  vim , vi 
count no of words in a  files:     wc
copy files:      cp     source_file     destination_file
Deleting Files:   rm    filename
remove multiple files at a time:    rm   filename1   filename2    filename3 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cat    /etc/passwd  >  /tmp/out   # redirect cat's standard out to /tmp/foo
cat    /nonexistant 2> /tmp/err   # redirect cat's standard error to /tmp/error
cat     < /etc/passwd                     # redirect cat's standard input to /etc/passwd

cat < /etc/passwd > /tmp/out 2> /tmp/err

ls -al myfirstscript 1> longlisting
ls -al myfirstscript >> longlisting
cat < myfirstscript >    mynewscript  == cp myfirstscript mynewscript

linux file system 

Meta data information kept separately.”inodes” are used for describing files.
As we learned, data held in files is kept in data blocks
Each file in the system is described with an inode data structure
The inode contains the specifics of the file – the permissions, last access time, the blocks where data resides, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
soft link and hard link 

every file in the file system has a inode 
contains meta inforamtion about the  file 
they contains -- inode number, file size, owner information, permissions, file type, number of  links 
inode is a database of a file 

two types of links -- soft link  & hard link

soft link
soft link is a shortcut of a file 
soft link is also called as symbolic link 
the inode number of softlink file and original file is diffearent 
if we delete the  original file the soft link file cant not access 

hard link 
diffearent name of the same file 
it has same file size,  and same inode no between hardlink file and original file 
if we delete original file after also access data on hard link file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
u mask 
umask controls the file permissions 
based on umask value we will set a file &  directories permissions for super user and regular users 

default permissions in the file sytem 
files -- 666
directories   -- 777 

umask
umask for regular user -- 0002
umask for root -- 0022 

calculate permission for root 
file:  666 - 022  = 644
directory:  777 - 022 = 755

calculcate permissions for regular user 
file: 666 - 002 = 664
directory:  777 - 002 = 775 

The default umask is now in /etc/login.defs

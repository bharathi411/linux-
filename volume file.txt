Disk Partitioning:
1.view all disk in luinx the following command list all existing disk partion
    fdisk -l
2.view specific Disk Partition in Linux -l wth device name
   fdisk -l /dev/xvdf

3.Check all Available fdisk Commands Simply use the following command 
   fdisk /dev/xvdf
    after that press m
    press n for add new partion
     press double enter
      add mermory +4G our here adding the volume size
         press t
         press L to select lvm or swap like this options
         wq
4. after that to take that changes to accept the kerenal version we are used the 
   following command 
      portprobe /dev/xvdf
5.after that to acess that partion volume we have to make a file system
   type lsblk
   after that  mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1
6.mounting the device
   mkdir newfile
   mount /dev/xvdf newfile
7.after that to check mounting point is done or not for that we use
    df -Th
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for permanet mounting we have updating the vi /etc/fstab
 inthat
  /dev/xvdf1  /root/new   xfs  defaults  0  0 give the details as follow 
then u restart ur server the mounting is not delete
------------------------------------------------------------------
Swap space
Swap space is the second type of memory in modern Linux systems. The primary function of swap space is to 
substitute disk space for RAM memory when real RAM fills up and more space is needed.
1.free -m .......to check free space
2.swapon -s  to see usage of swap
2.mkswap /dev/xvdf  .....to create file syatem for swap
3.swapon /dev/xvdf .....to activate mount
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical Volume Management (LVM)
1.makes it easier to manage disk space. If a file system needs more space it can be added to its logical volumes
 from the free spaces in its volume group and the file system can be re-sized as we wish
 
2.If a disk starts to fail, replacement disk can be registered as a physical volume with the 
volume group and the logical volumes extents can be migrated to the new disk without data loss..  

for that we have following steps follow for creating of the logical volumes
1.lsblk  check using this command for to see the disk partions
 2.fdisk  /dev/xvdf to enter into the particular device
    press m ----for help
    press n ----for new partion
     enter
     enter
     add memory +2G
     press t
      press L
       here select the 8e this is for the slection of lvm file system
        wq
3. afer that partprobe /dev/xvdf-------to reboot the kernel
same procedure for another device also
#now create the physical volume
  pvcreate /dev/xvdf1 /dev/xvdf2
#pvs -----to show all pvs
afer that now create volume group
  #vgcreate vGo /dev/xvdf1 /dev/xvdf2
  # vgs --------
  # lvcreate -n lvo -L +2G vGo------to create logical volume
  # Lvdisply /dev/vGo/lvo
  #mkfs.xfs /dev/vGo/lvo------to create file system
  #mkdir test
    #mount /dev/vGo/test  /test ----------for mounting purpose
    # df -h to check mont is done or not
